## Installation

Here's how to set up your development environment and install the necessary dependencies to run the FreButiqe e-commerce website:

### Prerequisites:

**Operating System:** Any operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) will work as long as you can install the required dependencies.

**Python:** Download and install Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH environment variable during installation.
Steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ``` clone
      Bash
      git clone https://github.com/Abel-alx-github/portfolio-alx.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ``` cd to folder
       cd portfolio-alx

3. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

   A virtual environment is a self-contained Python environment that isolates dependencies for this project from 
   other projects on your system. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment for better project 
   management. Here's how to create one using venv:
   ``` create venv
       python -m venv venv  # Replace 'venv' with your desired virtual environment name

       Now, activate the virtual environment:

       # Windows
       venv\Scripts\activate.bat

       # macOS/Linux
       source venv/bin/activate
   ```
 4. Install Dependencies:

   ``` 
      pip install -r requirements.txt
